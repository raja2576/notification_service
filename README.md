## 🧠 Assumptions

* Users exist in the database before sending notifications.
*---

### 🆕 Automatic User Registration

If a notification is sent to a user ID that is not already registered in the system, the service will **automatically create the user** in the database before sending the notification. This helps reduce the overhead of pre-registering users and supports seamless integration with external systems.

✅ **Supported For:**

* Email Notifications
* SMS Notifications
* In-App Notifications

🔄 **Workflow Example:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Client ->> Notification API: Send POST /notifications
    alt User ID Not Found
        Notification API ->> UserService: Create new user (userId)
        UserService ->> DB: Insert user record
    end
    Notification API ->> NotificationService: Process notification
    NotificationService ->> Queue/Email/SMS: Deliver notification
```

📦 **Sample Request:**

```json
{
  "userId": "newUser123",
  "type": "sms",
  "subject": "Welcome!",
  "message": "You are now registered and this is your first notification.",
  "phone": "+919999999999"
}

```

📝 **Note:**

* The `userId`, `email`, or `phone` is used to auto-create the user.
* Duplicate `userId`s will not be re-created — the system checks for existence before insert.

---

* SMS and Email require phone and email respectively.
* RabbitMQ and Twilio credentials are correctly configured.
* In-app messages are stored for audit/log purposes.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Admin dashboard to view logs and notification history
* WebSocket push notifications for real-time updates
* Retry mechanism for failed notifications
* Localization support (multi-language templates)
